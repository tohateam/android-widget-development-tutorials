Originally hosted with a series of articles on Android widgets, this code goes along with the following three developer.com articles:

  1. <a href='http://j.mp/c6uP27'>Creating a Home Screen App Widget on Android</a>
  1. <a href='http://j.mp/cz0jhm'>Handling User Interaction with Android App Widgets</a>
  1. <a href='http://j.mp/bMu36o'>Handling Lengthy Operations with Android App Widgets</a>

The articles, and code, target Android 1.5. There have been some minor changes to how widgets work. As-is, the code runs on Android 2.2 on an Evo 4G, but there are some internal errors in the log that need to be looked at.
